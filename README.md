* 12 views 
* components
    * layout
    * card
    * categories
    * search bar
    * nav bar
    * flash message
* TailwindCSS full design with flexbox approach and many custom configs
* fade animation with JS interaction.observer

## Front-End Development Homework
* Applying part of APIs to the features like sort, and displaying all categories/popular categories

## Challanges of this projects
* Facing many bugs and debugging it
* Authorization with api, end up using web middleware in api so I can acccess the user then I can authenticate it based on their stored information
* Learning so much about middleware and route
* Deeper with php artisan to know that route actions doesn't properly refreshed with reload
* Wrestling with API doesn't returning JSON because of authentication problem
